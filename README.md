# TrollStore-UICache
An app to run a uicache on your iPhone using the TrollStore root helper to avoid licensing issues

This app has a simple ui and a countdown for when the uicache finishes (takes about 32 seconds for me) and a progress bar for it

Useful for Mugunghwa to automatically run a uicache without licensing issues
